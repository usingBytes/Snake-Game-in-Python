Thanks everyone for following along!
Feel free to download the source code from https://github.com/usingBytes
I'll also have links in the description of the video

Try making some changes to the code. If you need some ideas you could try making the snake look more like a snake, or you could add some sounds to the game.
Another idea is you could add a timer that counts down every time fruit spawns, if you don't eat the fruit before the timer runs out you could have the game area close in on the player.
Thanks again for watching!
